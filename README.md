# Country Information Database

# About

### Why are we doing this? 

The overall objective of the project is to create a Spring Boot API, with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies, that encapsulates all fundamental and practical modules covered during training. Specifically, the project aims to create a Spring Boot API using Java, a managed database hosted locally or within the Cloud (H2 or MySQL) and the ability of making API calls (Postman) and checking persistence (Workbench or H2 console). 

The projects main objective is to create a Country Information Database that is used to store information of countries in the world including their capital city, continent where they are located and it's overall population.

### How I expected the challenge to go?

I expected to be a very steep climb to get around the concepts learned during training but as time progressed I managed to recall many of the knowledge gained throughout the lessons and applied it to the project.

### What went well? / What didn't go as planned?

Overall I think I managed my time properly which it was one my biggest concerns considering the time constraints, in terms of things that did not go as planned was the ability to add more features to the application.

### Possible improvements for future revisions of the project

The project can be expanded by adding more features including links to maps, population changes throughout time and demographics data.

# Scope

- Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the feature-branch model: main/dev/multiple features.
- A project management board with full expansion on user stories, acceptance criteria and tasks needed to complete the project.
- A risk assessment which outlines the issues and risks faced during the project timeframe.
- A relational database, locally or within the Cloud, which is used to persist data for the project.
- A functional application ‘back-end’, written in Java/Spring Boot, which meet the requirements set on Jira board.
- A build (.jar) of the application, including any dependencies, produced using an integrated build tool (Maven).
- A series of API calls designed with postman, used for CRUD functionality. (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Fully designed test suites for the application, including both unit and integration tests.
